<p>Information Systems Engineering Student. PyData2019 Volunteer. Enthusiastic about artificial intelligence, science, software engineer, coding and open source.</p>
<p>I like to see patterns and outliers, the mapping of knowledge from one field to another, so naturally I'm passionate about the field of General AI, and specifically about Machine Learning.</p>

<p class="mb-5">Musician, who love plays the electric bass and the Kontrabass! ;)</p>
